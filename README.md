# 🎮 XR Gesture Controls

This project uses intuitive hand gestures to interact with virtual objects in the XR Lab.  
Below is the mapping of gestures to their corresponding actions:

| Gesture | Action        | Usage              |
|---------|---------------|--------------------|
| 👌 Pinch | Select object | Pick up equipment  |
| ✋ Open Palm | Release object | Drop equipment   |
| 🤏 Two-finger Pinch | Adjust size   | Resize objects |
| ↻ Circular Motion | Stir | Mix solutions |
| 👇 Point | Select UI | Navigate menus |
| 👐 Two-hand Grab | Rotate | Examine objects |

---

✨ With these gestures, users can naturally interact with and manipulate lab equipment in XR.


## 🎮 How to Use / Gesture Guide

Once the application is running on your headset:

1.  **Calibrate Your Hands**: Hold your hands in view of the headset's cameras until they are fully tracked.
2.  **Navigate the Lab**: Use your gaze or pinch to point and select UI elements.
3.  **Perform Experiments**:
    *   **Select Object**: Pinch your index finger and thumb together over an object.
    *   **Move Object**: While pinching, move your hand to relocate the object.
    *   **Pour Liquid**: Pinch a container, tilt your hand past a certain angle to pour.
    *   **Mix**: Hold a beaker and make a slow, circular stirring motion.
    *   **Ignite Burner**: Snap your fingers near the Bunsen burner.
